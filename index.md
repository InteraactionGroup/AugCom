## Why AugCom ?

This app is accessible online, on the most famous browsers (google-chrome, ...), but it can also be used offline from your first visit, thanks to its "Progressive Web App" system!

You can create and save your own communication grids, by adding your favorite images and photos, or by searching for pictograms in the image libraries already integrated in the application!

Add your own color palettes, print and save your communication grids in PDF format and let your child express himself loud and clear thanks to the voice synthesis integrated directly into your browser!
